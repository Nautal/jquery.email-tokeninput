{"name":"Jquery.email-tokeninput","tagline":"A jQuery plugin to create a cusom input field to enter multiple valid emails","body":"### Why I built this plugin\r\nI was building a laravel sass application where an account creator needed to be able to invite his/her team members by easily adding email addresses in a auto-expanding tokeninput field. I didn't feel like other solutions fit my use case, so I built this plugin.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nThis plugin relies on [jquery.autosize.input](https://github.com/MartinF/jQuery.Autosize.Input) made by [Github user Martin F](https://github.com/MartinF) so remember to include this (it's included in this repository).\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nDownload the zip and get the files from the `dist` folder\r\n\r\nor use bower\r\n```javascript\r\nbower install jquery-email-tokeninput\r\n```\r\nOptionally you can use bower-installer to place the files correctly, just run `bower-installer`\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nInclude `autosize` and `email-tokeninput` and the CSS file in your HTML\r\n```hmtl\r\n<script src=\"jquery.autosize.min.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"jquery.email-tokeninput.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"email-tokeninput.css\" charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd an empty `div` with a class to your HTML  \r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"mailtoken\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nCall mailtoken on the empty div\r\n```html\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n    $('.mailtoken').mailToken();\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What gets sent to the server\r\nGetting the value in (php)\r\n```php\r\n$emails = json_decode($_POST['emailtoken']);\r\n```\r\nThis is the format the server receives\r\n```javascript\r\n[\r\n    { \"email\" : \"user1@faker.com\" },\r\n    { \"email\" : \"user2@faker.com\" },\r\n    { \"email\" : \"user3@faker.com\" }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Known issues\r\n* Plugin breaks if more than one instance of emailtoken on the page\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with this package? or found a bug? create a [new issue](https://github.com/olde86/jquery.email-tokeninput/issues/new) on Github or [contact me](http://www.oldenborg.nu) through my website and Iâ€™ll help you sort it out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
